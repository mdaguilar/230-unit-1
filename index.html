        <h1>The Impact of Third Place Deserts on Disciplinary Event Reports at East Side Union High Schools</h1>
        <p>My project investigates how the lack of third spaces for teens to explore is impacting the amount of disciplinary events that are reported at high schools in the East Side Union High School District.</p>

        <h2>Datasets</h2>
        <p>This area will show what datasets are being used for this project. This will contain a variety of point, line, and polygon layers. They will represent the locations of public high schools, third places (such as libraries and community centers), and more.<br><br>
        Additionally, a dataset that holds the disciplinary event data from the past four years will be linked: both the original website source and an actual spreadsheet.</p>
